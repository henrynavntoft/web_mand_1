Mandatory # 1

Using python "Bottle", docker, mixhtml, and ArangoDB:

Create a website that can do a CRUD against the "users" collection in ArangoDB.

The page can:

Create a user (name and last name)
View all users
Delete a user based on the user's _id
Update a user (name and/or last name) based on the user's _id

Tips
Look at the pattern
In Python use a module named requests to do POST
mixhtml has mix-blur


NOTES:
Only POST to this URL
/_db/_system/_api/cursor

Add in the raw body json e.g.:
{
  "query": "FOR user IN users RETURN user"
}

This e.g. will return all users
